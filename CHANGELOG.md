# Changelog

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Critical — code review v3)
- **`disconnect()` crash (#48)**: `fetcher.disconnect()` no longer crashes with `AttributeError` when `connect()` never succeeded — added `hasattr(self, 'mail')` guard
- **Password email processed too early (#49)**: password emails only marked as processed when extraction actually succeeds — failed extractions will be retried next run (both pre-scan and main loop)

### Fixed (High — code review v3)
- **IMAP re-download loop (#50)**: emails producing only duplicate records are now moved to processed folder — previously re-downloaded and re-parsed every run
- **Double master.xlsx read (#51)**: `load_existing_keys()` reads column headers once and reuses, instead of opening the file twice
- **col_familia guard (#53/#54)**: 5 parsers (psb, sber, soglasie, kaplife, yugoriya) now return `[]` with error log when 'Фамилия' column not found — prevents silent 0-record output
- **Cumulative zip size limit (#55)**: zip extraction now tracks cumulative extracted size and stops at 500MB total (in addition to existing 100MB per-entry limit)

### Fixed (Medium — code review v3)
- **Monthly report date filter (#56)**: dates now zero-padded before month matching — `1.3.2026` correctly matches `03.2026` suffix
- **Sender detection hardened (#57)**: `detect_by_sender()` now uses exact email match or `@domain` suffix check for full-email sender keys — substring-only matching limited to partial keys like `spiskirobot`
- **Config validation (#58)**: `load_config()` now validates required keys (`imap.server`, `imap.username`, `imap.password`, `processing.temp_folder`, `processing.processed_ids_file`) on startup with clear error messages

### Added (Tests — code review v3)
- **`_safe()` tests (#52)**: 13 tests for formula injection prevention — covers `=`, `+`, `@`, `\t`, `\r`, `-` prefixes, negative numbers, None, empty string
- **`zetta_handler` tests (#59)**: 17 tests for sender detection, monthly/per-email password extraction, zip extraction, zip slip blocking, invalid zip handling
- **`clinic_matcher` tests (#59)**: 9 tests for clinic keyword matching, longest-keyword-wins, extract_comment flag, missing clinics.yaml, policy comment extraction
- **Dedup edge case tests (#59)**: `ё`→`е` normalization, date zero-padding, clinic-in-key differentiation
- **Sender detection tests (#59)**: 8 tests for exact match, domain match, partial key, case insensitivity, all known senders
- Test count: 50 → 103 (87 self-contained + 16 fixture-dependent)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Low — code review v2)
- **`_safe()` negative numbers (#34)**: `-500` no longer gets formula-injection prefix — only prefixes `-` when not followed by a digit
- **BOM mid-file (#35)**: `utf-8-sig` encoding only used for new CSV files; appends use plain `utf-8` — fixes BOM bytes appearing mid-file (writer.py, main.py x2)
- **`.bak` cleanup (#36)**: `master.xlsx.bak` removed after successful write — prevents stale backup accumulation
- **`wb.close()` (#37)**: `_build_xlsx()` in notifier.py now closes workbook in `finally` block
- **`import json` (#38)**: moved from top-level to local import in fetcher.py migration path (only used once)
- **Efficient processed IDs (#39)**: `_save_processed_ids()` now only inserts newly-added IDs (diff from snapshot) instead of re-inserting entire set
- **Pre-scan password marking (#40)**: password-only emails now marked as processed during pre-scan pass
- **Zip bomb guard (#41)**: 100MB per-entry size limit before extraction in zetta_handler.py
- **Filename sanitization (#42)**: control characters stripped from attachment filenames in fetcher.py
- **`format_date` datetime formats (#43)**: added `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` and `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS` format support
- **`get_cell_str` float-to-int (#44)**: `123456.0` now renders as `"123456"` instead of `"123456.0"`
- **FIO column guard (#46)**: 6 parsers (absolut, reso, vsk, euroins, renins, zetta) now return `[]` with error log when FIO column not found
- **Config graceful default (#47)**: `config['output']['master_file']` uses `.get()` with `'./output/master.xlsx'` default in both `run_imap_mode` and `run_local_mode`
- Updated test for `.bak` cleanup behavior
- **Test mode encoding**: fixed `--test` crash on Windows (cp1252 console) — replaced emoji with ASCII, force utf-8 stdout

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Medium — code review v2)
- **Cross-run dedup broken (#24)**: clinic detection now runs BEFORE the dedup filter in `process_file()` — previously `Клиника` was always empty in the dedup key for incoming records, so duplicates were never detected against the master
- **Network share formula injection (#25)**: `_export_to_network()` now applies `_safe()` to all CSV cell values (daily delta + monthly master)
- **Monthly report month filter (#26)**: changed `str.contains()` to `str.endswith()` for precise month matching — prevents false matches on malformed dates
- **Per-email error handling (#27)**: main fetch loop now wrapped in per-email try/except — one malformed email no longer aborts the entire run and loses all collected results
- **IMAP FETCH response guard (#28)**: structural check on `msg_data` shape before indexing — prevents crash on malformed/expunged responses
- **UID EXPUNGE (#29)**: `move_to_folder()` now uses `UID EXPUNGE` (RFC 4315) to only expunge our UIDs, with fallback to plain EXPUNGE
- **File handle leak (#30)**: `_file_to_text()` and `extract_policy_comment()` in `clinic_matcher.py` now use `with pd.ExcelFile()` — prevents file handle leaks on Windows
- **Shadowed variable (#31)**: removed duplicate `processed_imap_ids = []` initialization in `run_imap_mode()`
- **Zetta no-xlsx detection (#32)**: `try_passwords()` now checks if zip contains xlsx files before trying passwords — prevents infinite retry on zips with no xlsx content
- **Alfa header fail-safe (#33)**: `alfa.py` now returns `[]` with error log when header row is not found, instead of silently parsing with hardcoded column indices

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-19
### Changed / Fixed (Low)
- **FIO casing**: all 10 parsers that weren't uppercasing FIO now do — consistent `UPPERCASE` in master.xlsx across all 15 parsers
- **IMAP socket timeout**: 60-second timeout added to `IMAP4_SSL` — prevents indefinite hang on unresponsive server
- **`_clinics` cache**: added `reload_clinics()` helper to invalidate module-level cache (useful in tests)
- **Header length guard**: replaced magic `60` with named constant `_MAX_HEADER_LEN` in `clinic_matcher.py`
- **Detector sheet comment**: added comment explaining why only sheet 0 is scanned for format detection
- **Redundant import**: removed inline `from clinic_matcher import extract_policy_comment` in `main.py` (already imported at module level)
- **Dead code**: deleted unused `_build_csv()` function and orphaned `import csv` from `notifier.py`
- **Dead code (#19)**: `if False` on MOVE command was already removed in v1.6.0 IMAP UID migration — marked resolved
- **CLAUDE.md version**: updated from v1.5.0 to v1.6.3

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Medium)
- **Zetta zip retry**: Zetta zip `message_id` no longer marked processed when extraction fails — failed zips will be retried on the next run (`fetcher.py`)
- **Multi-file zip cleanup**: `_extract_dir` now only set on the last result item from each zip, preventing premature directory deletion while other files from the same zip are still pending (`fetcher.py`)
- **Master backup restore**: `write_batch_to_master()` now catches `_append_to_existing()` failures and auto-restores `master.xlsx` from `.bak` before re-raising (`writer.py`)
- **`format_date()` silent fallback**: logs a `WARNING` when a date string matches no known format and is returned as-is (`parsers/utils.py`)
- **Daily network CSV append**: `_export_to_network()` daily delta file now appends across runs in the same day instead of silently overwriting (`main.py`)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Medium)
- **Per-row try/except in all parsers**: all 15 parser data loops now catch per-row exceptions and skip bad rows with a warning instead of aborting the entire file — `alfa.py`, `kaplife.py` (both loops), `generic_parser.py` added; 13 parsers were already done in v1.6.0
- **CSV formula injection**: `_export_csv()` in `writer.py` now applies `_safe()` to each cell value before writing
- **Email attachment formula injection**: `_build_xlsx()` in `notifier.py` now applies `_safe()` to each cell value

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed (Critical)
- **IMAP UIDs**: all IMAP operations now use stable UIDs (`uid('SEARCH'/'FETCH'/'COPY'/'STORE')`) instead of volatile sequence numbers — prevents moving/deleting wrong emails
- **Processed IDs timing**: `_save_processed_ids()` moved from `fetch_attachments()` to `main.py` after successful batch write — emails can now be retried on crash
- **`find_col() or find_col()` column-zero bug**: added `first_col()` helper to `parsers/utils.py` and replaced all `or`-chained `find_col()` calls in 11 parsers — column at index 0 no longer silently falls through
- **Clinic keyword global sort**: `clinic_matcher.py` now builds a flat keyword list sorted globally by length (longest first) — cross-clinic partial matches no longer depend on YAML file order
### Fixed (Medium)
- **Password extraction crash**: added `if payload is None: continue` guard in per-email password extraction (`fetcher.py`) — malformed emails no longer crash the fetch loop
### Fixed (Tests)
- Updated `test_dedup.py` and `test_writer.py` to use 5-tuple dedup keys (including `Клиника` field added in v1.4.1)

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-18

- `clinic_matcher.py` logs a warning when `extract_policy_comment()` finds nothing, with a hint on what to add

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-18
### Added
- `Комментарий в полис` column — universal policy comment extractor

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-18
### Changed
